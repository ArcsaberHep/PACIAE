Up to now PACIAE model has three versions of PACIAE2.0, PACIAE2.1, 
PACIAE2.2, and PACIAE2.2.1. In each version there has three series: 
the series "a" describing the relativistic elementary collisions (pp, e+e-, etc.), 
"b" and "c" series describing the relativistic nucleus-nucleus
(A+B, p+A, etc.) collisions. Specially pointed, PACIAE2.2.1 "b" and "c" series 
can describe the relativistic nucleus-nucleus of A+A collisions with 
the chiral magnetic effect(CME).

The practice routine for running PACIAE model is as follows 
(PACIAE221b as an example):
 1) Decompress the file of 221b.tar.gz.
 2) Compile and link the programs by commands:
    gfortran -O -c main_221b.f, parini_221b.f, parcas_221b.f, sfm_221b.f,
    coales_221b.f, hadcas_221b.f, p221b.f
    gfortran -O -o pcm_221b.e main_221b.o parini_221b.o parcas_221b.o sfm_221b.o 
     coales_221b.o hadcas_221b.o p221b.o
 3) Modify the input file of usu.dat(this version includes usu_Au.dat or usu_Pb.dat) 
    according to your wish.
 4) Run the program by command:
    time ./pcm_221b.e
