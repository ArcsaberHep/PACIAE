Heretofore the PACIAE model has three series of a, b and c for each version of 
PACIAE2.0, PACIAE2.1, PACIAE2.2, and PACIAE2.2.1. The series "a" describing 
the relativistic elementary collisions (pp, e+e-, etc.), "b" and "c" series 
describing the relativistic nucleus-nucleus (A+B, p+A, etc.) collisions with
different topological program structure (See Comput. Phys. Comm. 183 (2012) 333
for detail). In this version the three series are integrated into one series 
which is named PACIAE2.2.2. 

The practice routine for running PACIAE model is as follows:
 1) Decompress the file of p222.tar.gz or p222.zip.
 2) Compile and link the programs by commands:
    gfortran -O -c main_222.f parini_222.f parcas_222.f sfm_222.f coales_222.f hadcas_222.f p_222.f analy.f
    gfortran -O -o pcm_222.e main_222.o parini_222.o parcas_222.o sfm_222.o coales_222.o hadcas_222.o p_222.o analy.o
 3) Modify the input file of usu.dat according to your wish.
 4) Run the program by command: 
    time ./pcm_222.e
 5) The main output file is rms.out.
