Up to now PACIAE model has three versions of PACIAE2.0, PACIAE2.1,
and PACIAE2.2. In each version there has three series: the series ``a" 
describing the relativistic elementary collisions (pp, e+e-, etc.), 
``b" and ``c"  series describing the relativistic nucleus-nucleus
(A+B, p+A, etc.) collisions. 

The practice routine for running PACIAE model is as follows 
(PACIAE2.1b as an example):
 1) Decompress the file of 21b.tar.gz.
 2) Compile and link the programs by commands:
    gfortran -O -c main_21b.f, parini_21b.f, parcas_21b.f, sfm_21b.f,
    coales_21b.f, hadcas_21b.f, p21b.f
    gfortran -O -o pcm_21b.e main_21b.o parini_21b.o parcas_21b.o sfm_21b.o 
     coales_21b.o hadcas_21b.o p21b.o
 3) Modify the input file of usu.dat according to your wish.
 4) Run the program by command:
    time ./pcm_21b.e
